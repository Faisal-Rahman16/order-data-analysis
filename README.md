In this project, I extracted Amazon order data from Kaggle using Python and performed data analysis to derive business insights. I started by loading and exploring the dataset,
carrying out necessary preprocessing steps like handling missing values, cleaning data, and transforming it into a structured format for analysis.

Using Python, I leveraged libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation. After completing the Python analysis,
I transitioned to SQL for further analysis, where I executed specific queries to address business questions and support decision-making, such as 
identifying top-performing products, customer segments, month over month sales growth and optimizing sales strategies.

By utilizing both Python and SQL, I efficiently processed the data and provided actionable insights to drive strategic business decisions.
